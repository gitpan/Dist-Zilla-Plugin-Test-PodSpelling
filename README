NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PodSpelling - Author tests for POD spelling

VERSION
    version 2.004004

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

            [Test::PodSpelling]

    or:

            [Test::PodSpelling]
            directories = docs
            wordlist = Pod::Wordlist
            spell_cmd = aspell list
            stopwords = CPAN
            stopwords = github
            stopwords = stopwords
            stopwords = wordlist

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following file:

      xt/author/pod-spell.t - a standard Test::Spelling test

ATTRIBUTES
  directories
    Additional directories you wish to search for POD spell checking
    purposes. "bin" and "lib" are set by default.

  wordlist
    The module name of a word list you wish to use that works with
    Test::Spelling.

    Defaults to Pod::Wordlist::hanekomu.

  spell_cmd
    If "spell_cmd" is set then "set_spell_cmd( your_spell_command );" is
    added to the test file to allow for custom spell check programs.

    Defaults to nothing.

  stopwords
    If stopwords is set then "add_stopwords( <DATA> )" is added to the test
    file and the words are added after the "__DATA__" section.

    "stopwords" can appear multiple times, one word per line.

    Normally no stopwords are added by default, but author names appearing
    in "dist.ini" are automatically added as stopwords so you don't have to
    add them manually just because they might appear in the "AUTHORS"
    section of the generated POD document.

METHODS
  add_stopword
    Called to add stopwords to the stopwords array. It is used to determine
    if automagically detected words are valid and print out debug logging
    for the process.
